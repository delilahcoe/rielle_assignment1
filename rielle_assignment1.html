    <p>The only background I have with HTML and CSS is from WRA 210. I have experience with JavaScript from XA 310. I also took AP computer science in high school in which we learned JavaScript.</p>

    <p>From WRA 410, I would like to expand my knowledge on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. From the knowledge I have right now, especially regarding HTML and CSS, I don't think I would be thrive in a position where those skills are needed. From this class, I hope to improve my skills in these areas and feel more confident in using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>
